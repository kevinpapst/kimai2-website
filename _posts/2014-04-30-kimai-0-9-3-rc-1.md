A last test release before we can finally publish Kimai 0.9.3 :-)

Please test this version and give use your feedback, so we can publish the final release soon.

Grab the ZIP file from here: [kimai_0.9.3.rc1.zip](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/releases/download/v0.9.3-rc.1/kimai_0.9.3.rc1.zip)

Here is the release: [GitHub v0.9.3-rc.1 release](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/releases/tag/v0.9.3-rc.1)

And these are all included [changes since the last beta version](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/issues?milestone=1&state=closed).

Thanks for time-tracking with Kimai!
