I have spent the last days changing the website again, to include all available information and documentation for Kimai v1 and Kimai v2.

After having the [website dedicated to Kimai 2]({% link _posts/2018-02-10-a-new-website.md %}) for about one year now at 
https://v2.kimai.org and the main website still showing the years old version dedicated to Kimai v1, it was finally time to 
show everyone that Kimai 2 is on a good track to be used in production.

As I spent a lot of time using and contributing to open source software, I wanted to use a free theme as well.
After long research I decided to use [tabler](https://tabler.io/) and customize it to my own needs.
Thankfully it is written for Jekyll, so I could care more about the content restructuring, instead of the code.

I hope that the clean approach with responsiveness will give us some more SEO love from Google. 
While cleaning up the content, I also moved the [complete documentation]({% link _documentation/index.md %}) from the Kimai v2 repository to this website.
It is still shipped with the next release of Kimai, but will be removed from the GitHub repository in the near future.

Say goodbye to the *intermediate* website design:
