Just to let our reader (via RSS feed) know, I created a page for external applications which make use of our API.

You find that new page at [http://www.kimai.org/apps/](http://www.kimai.org/apps/)

These apps could simplify your time-tracking process :)

If you know more apps, let us know in the comments and I will update the page.
