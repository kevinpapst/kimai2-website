						<h1><a href="#">Kimai - time-tracking for everyone</a></h1>
						<p>
						Kimai is a free open source timetracker. It tracks work time and prints out a summary of your activities on demand.
						Yearly, monthly, daily, by customer, by project, by action …
						It’s simplicity is its strength. Due to Kimai’s web browser based interface it runs cross-platform.
						</p>

					<blockquote>
						While there are many programs one can use for time and project tracking, they tend to be overkill for my rather simple needs.
						Kimai came about because I was tired to feed lame boring excel tables …
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Kimai does not have to run while recording, you can even quit your browser.
						Your time is still recording until you stop it from any web browser that has access to your installation.
						It is designed to hold lots of users, but you can also use it for a single user if you want to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kimai can be localized to any language, though we only ship three sets of languages files in the new version for now: English, German and Russian.
						Feel free to send your self-made language files – we’re looking for translators and would appreciate your support!
					</p>

						And if want to know what others have to say about us, check out <a href="/testimonials/">the testimonials</a>.
