## History of Kimai

Kimai has a long history and was way ahead of its time, when the team around Torsten Höltge started its development in 2006. 
It had a responsive design (thanks to a lot of javascript magic) back in the time when that word wasn't even officially invented.

He wanted to [shut it down](/blog/2009/bye-bye-folks/) due to personal/time limitations, when it was [taken over by Kevin](/blog/2009/the-condemned-live-longer/).
With the help of other open source volunteers he was able to keep it alive and extend it for multiple years.

In the meantime the PHP community made great steps forward and Kimai felt back, due to its technical history - built around a lot of single PHP scripts which all had to be public accessible.
It had also some major drawbacks, like very limited capabilities of extending it. Also, after many years of development, the code base became hard to maintain and the logic was wildly spread among scripts, classes and the frontend layer.
 
Thats why the idea of rewriting Kimai in modern frameworks was there for a very long time, also driven by community requests, but (honestly) we simply had no time to push these ideas forward. 
In the end of 2017 Symfony released its framework in the version 4.0 along with a neat tool called Flex.
Thats when we took the opportunity and started the development of the next evolutional step: Kimai v2 reloaded was born.

The software Kimai is now almost 15 years old and is used all over the world. We are proud of that and about its great community. 
Thats why we would like to thank each and everyone who contributed to Kimai.
There were way too many people to name them all, so this list is only a small compilation of the people who contributed huge amounts of time, code, thoughts and help to Kimai and its community:
 
- [Torsten Höltge](http://www.theauditorymisled.de/) - the original creator of Kimai
- [Severin Leonhardt](https://github.com/ServiusHack) - a core maintainer of Kimai for a long time
- [Simon Schaufelberger](https://github.com/simonschaufi) - core developer for a very long time ... and on-going!
- You can find a list of all [contributors](https://github.com/kimai/kimai/graphs/contributors) at GitHub
- Kimai v1 was also highly influenced by Oleg Britvin, Martin Klemkow, Vasilis van Gemert, Maximilian Kern, Enrico Ties, Thomas Wensing, John Resig, Kelvin Luck, Urs Gerig, Willem van Gemert, Torben Boe and HamBug Studios, Klaus Franken, Chris (Urban Willi), Andreas Berndt, Niels Hoffmann, Günter Hengsbach, Paul Brand, Joaquín G. de la Zerda, Allesandro Bertoldo, José Ricardo Cardoso, RRZE
