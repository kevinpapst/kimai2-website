	<h1>Kimai v1 Demo</h1>
    <p>
        <b>ATTENTION:</b> This is the demo of the outdated Kimai v1.
        <br>
        We released Kimai v2 in the meantime and would invite you to head over to our <a href="/demo/">demo page</a>.  
    </p>
</header>

This page leads you to a [demo installation]({{ site.demo_url }}) of Kimai, where you can get a first
impression on how this software feels and which functionality it provides.
If you encounter any problem, we would kindly ask you to send us a [message in our issue tracker]({{ site.issues_url }}).
Please notice, that the Demo will be reinstalled on a regular schedule and all entered data will be removed.

### Current state

Click the button below and you will be redirected to a page where you receive a unique user-login for your test. 

<script src="{{ site.demo_url }}/status.php"></script>

## Login

As Kimai forbids multiple sessions for the same user, the previously logged-in user will be logged out, if another
login occurs for that same account. Therefor is it recommended to create your own test-account instead of using the
following "admin" account:

*   Website: [{{ site.demo_url }}]({{ site.demo_url }})
*   Username: admin
*   Password: changeme

## Note

The demo is always created from the latest [development version]({{ site.docu_url }}developer/index.html).
It's possible, that you find bugs, which will not be available in a release version.
The Kimai Demo will be reinstalled multiple times a day, that's why you cannot perform long-time tests.

## External demos

There is a demo hosted externally by [Softaculous](http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/demos/Kimai/). 
Please keep in mind that we do not provide help with problems in this installation.
