	<blockquote cite="Torsten Höltge">
		While there are many programs one can use for time and project tracking, they tend to be overkill for my rather simple needs.
		Kimai came about because I was tired to feed lame boring excel tables …

	<p>
		Kimai does not have to run while recording, you can even quit your browser.
		Your time is still recording until you stop it from any web browser that has access to your installation.
		It is designed to hold lots of users, but you can also use it for a single user if you want to.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kimai can be localized to any language and we ship the following sets of translations:
		english, german, russian, italian, french, spanish, hungarian, arabic.
		Feel free to send your self-made language files – we’re looking for translators and would appreciate your support!
