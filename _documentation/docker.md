description: Running Kimai inside docker
toc: true
---

The Dockerfile supplied with this application is a development or demonstration docker. 
It runs a self contained version of Kimai 2 using a SQLite database in the docker container.

There is an official docker repo for Kimai 2 that includes the Docker file from this repo and a docker file suitable for running in a production environment.

- You find this docker repo at: [https://github.com/tobybatch/kimai2](https://github.com/tobybatch/kimai2)
- The repo at dockerhub auto-building the prod and dev containers: [https://hub.docker.com/r/kimai/kimai2](https://hub.docker.com/r/kimai/kimai2).
 
Any issues with the container rather than the application itself should be raised [here](https://github.com/tobybatch/kimai2/issues).

## Build the docker

```bash
docker build -t kimai/kimai2:dev .
```

## Run the docker

```bash
docker run -ti -p 8001:8001 --name kimai2 --rm kimai/kimai2:dev
```

You can then access the site on http://127.0.0.1:8001. If that doesn't work check the IP of your docker:

```bash
{% raw %}docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' kimai2{% endraw %}
```

You can find Kimai at that IP on port 8001.

### Mac using docker-machine

When using dock-machine on your Mac, you need to use the IP of your machine. 
Considering you started the machine named `default`, you find the IP with:

```bash
docker-machine ip default
```

## Running commands in the docker

You can run any command in the container in this fashion once it is started.  Add `-ti` to attach a terminal.

```bash
docker exec -ti kimai2 bash
```

### Create a user and dummy data

See the docs [here]({% link _documentation/installation.md %}) for full instructions, but this creates a user admin/admin with all privileges.

```bash
docker exec kimai2 bin/console kimai:create-user admin admin@example.com ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN admin
```

To install the fixtures:

```bash
docker exec kimai2 bin/console kimai:reset-dev
```

## Developing against the docker

It is possible to mount your source tree and sqlite DB into the container at run time.  
**N.B. The sqlite database needs to writable by the www-data user.** 
Use ```chown 33:33 kimai.sqlite``` on the host machine.

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8001:8001 \
    -v $(pwd)/src:/opt/kimai/src \
    -v $(pwd)/var/data/kimai.sqlite:/opt/kimai/var/data/kimai.sqlite \
    --name kimai2 kimai/kimai2:dev
```

Now edits in your local files will be served by the container and all database changes will persist.

The [official docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) has more options on running the container.

## Further docker solutions

As there are several approaches to docker images, you have multiple docker images to choose from.
