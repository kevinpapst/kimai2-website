## Widgets

Widgets are defined in the configuration node `kimai.widgets` and you find the pre-defined ones in [kimai.yaml]({{ site.kimai_v2_file }}/config/packages/kimai.yaml).

Here is an example of one widget definition:

```yaml
kimai:
    widgets:
        userDurationToday: { title: stats.durationToday, query: duration, user: true, begin: '00:00:00', end: '23:59:59', icon: duration, color: green }
```

Widgets are currently only used in the Dashboard, but maybe used in other template parts as well in the future.

### Widget settings

- `title` - the title of your widget (will be translated)
- `query` - the allowed queries to use for populating the widget data are `duration`, `rate`, `active` and `users`
- `user` - whether the query is executed for the current user or for all users. possible values are `true` and `false` (default: `false` - all data is used to calculate the result)
- `begin` - setting the start date for the query, formatted with the [PHP DateTime syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php) (default: `null` - a query matching any start date)
- `end` - setting the end date for the query, formatted with the [PHP DateTime syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php) (default: `null` - a query matching any end date)
- `color` - a color name, see all possible names in [theme settings]({% link _documentation/theme.md %}) (default: ``)
- `icon` - an icon alias from [theme settings]({% link _documentation/theme.md %}) or any other icon from [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/icons) (default: `null` - no icon)

## Dashboard sections

Within the dashboard all widgets are placed in sections (rows) like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    dashboard:
        user_duration:
            title: dashboard.you
            order: 10
            permission: ROLE_USER
            widgets: [userDurationToday, userDurationWeek, userDurationMonth, userDurationYear, userDurationTotal]
``` 

### Section settings

- `permission` - the name of a role who is allowed to see the widgets, see [users]({% link _documentation/users.md %})
- `title` - the title of a section, if omitted no title will be shown (default: `null`) 
- `widgets` - an array of widget names (see above for an example)
- `order` - allows to define the order of the section

### Default sections

The dashboard has the following default sections:

- `user_duration` - order 10
- `user_rates` - order 20
- `duration` - order 30
- `active_users` - order 40
- `rates` - order 50
- `admin` - order 100 (this section is programmatically added)  

### Overwriting sections

A section with an empty list of widgets will not be rendered.
If you don't like the default sections you can remove them by overwriting their widget list like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    dashboard:
        user_duration: { widgets: [] }
        user_rates: { widgets: [] }
        duration: { widgets: [] }
        active_users: { widgets: [] }
        rates: { widgets: [] }
```

It's also possible to change the title or the list of widgets for every section like this:

```yaml
kimai:
    dashboard:
        user_duration:
            title: 'some fancy widgets'
            widgets: [userDurationWeek, userDurationMonth, userDurationYear]
```

### Reorder sections

If you want to reorder the sections, you can overwrite as many sections as you want and simply change their `order` key. 
Lower numbers will be rendered before higher numbers. 

```yaml
kimai:
    dashboard:
        user_duration: { order: 30 }
        user_rates: { order: 90 }
        duration: { order: 40 }
        active_users: { order: 20 }
        rates: { order: 50 }
```

### Beta-test widgets

While working on the widgets, some of them were created for testing future functionalities of Kimai.
You can try them out, but I can't guarantee that they will be supported in the future, as I don't consider them to be `stable` for now.

You can try this configuration in your [local.yaml]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}) to see a chart instead of plain boxes for the last 2 years of monthly times:

```yaml
kimai:
    widgets:
        userRecapTwoYears: { title: stats.durationToday, query: monthly, user: true, begin: '01 january last year 00:00:00', end: '31 december this year 23:59:59', color: '#3b8bba|rgba(0,115,183,0.6);#c1c7d1|rgb(210,214,222,0.9)' }

    dashboard:
        user_duration:
            type: chart
            widgets: [userRecapTwoYears, userDurationToday, userDurationWeek, userDurationMonth, userDurationYear]
```

A brief description: the `monthly` query allows to fetch data by month and year, but the default widgets are not able to render this data.
So internally a __chart section template__ (`type: chart`) is used to render the data, which is also able to fetch and display the data for 
all of the following widgets in the configured section (the above example overwrites the widget config of the default `user_duration` section).

In order to work, the chart widget `userRecapTwoYears` needs to be the first in the section.

This widgets setup and configuration will likely change in the future, so keep an eye on this config if this widget  
doesn't work after one of the next updates!
